# external-tools.test.sh — tests for the RTK archive-validation helpers in

# executable into the user's $HOME, so a regression that weakens them is an
# arbitrary-file-write risk. Pin them.
#
# Plain bash (no bats). The helpers are pure (status only), so the tests need no
# network: _rtk_archive_has_unsafe_paths takes a tar member list, and
# _rtk_staged_binary_ok inspects a staged dir built under mktemp. Run via
# `npm test`; exits non-zero on any failure.
