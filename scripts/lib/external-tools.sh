# external-tools.sh — shared GSD/RTK/tldt logic for devskills.
#
# Sourced by install.sh and scripts/upgrade-deps.sh. Each public function takes
# a mode (install|upgrade). The underlying commands are identical for GSD and
# tldt (both fetch @latest); they differ only for RTK, where:
#   - install short-circuits when a correct rtk-ai binary is already present;
#   - install uses `brew install`, upgrade uses `brew upgrade || brew install`.
# The Linux download path and the old-hook purge are byte-identical either way,
# so they live here once instead of being copy-pasted into both scripts.
#
# Logging: install.sh and upgrade-deps.sh each define log()/warn() with their
# own prefix and this lib uses theirs (resolved at call time). DRY_RUN (0|1) is
# honored; defaults to 0.
