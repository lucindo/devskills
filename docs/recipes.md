# Recipes & Workflows

Worked examples of the devskills commands doing real work — and, more usefully, working *together*. These are opinionated suggestions, not the only way. For the dry reference (args, flags, behavior) see [commands.md](commands.md).

Everything here relies only on the commands, `git`, and `gh` — no external orchestration.

---

## Modes stack — run several at once

A **mode** (`/ds-tiger-style-mode`, `/ds-ui-mode`, `/ds-data-mode`, `/ds-test-mode`, `/ds-git-mode`, `/ds-step-mode`, `/ds-caveman-lite-mode` / `/ds-caveman-ultra-mode`) doesn't do a job and return — it changes *how* the agent works for the rest of the session. Modes **compose**: turn on as many as fit the work. Building a tested UI to a strict bar, committed cleanly as you go, is four at once —

```
/ds-tiger-style-mode             # safety + explicitness bar
/ds-ui-mode                      # component/state discipline + design craft
/ds-test-mode                    # keep the core honestly tested as you build
/ds-git-mode                     # commit each working unit, terse human messages, no history rewrite
   ...build it; all four stay active until the session ends...
```

To drop one mid-session, say so ("stop UI mode"); `/ds-caveman-lite-mode` and `/ds-caveman-ultra-mode` are the ones with explicit off-switches ("normal mode"). The caveman modes deliberately leave commit messages "written normally" — `/ds-git-mode` is what governs them, so the two compose cleanly. Everything else here — `/ds-spec`, `/ds-bug-review`, `/ds-verify-this`, … — is an **action**: it runs once and returns a result. The recipes below stitch the two together.

## Three ways to scope `/ds-code-quality-review`

`/ds-code-quality-review` treats its argument as the review scope. Pick the scope to match the question you're asking.

```
/ds-code-quality-review
```
**Recent changes.** No argument → the changed files on the current branch. This is the default pre-merge pass: "is the work I just did making the codebase worse?"

```
/ds-code-quality-review src/auth/ scripts/lib/
```
**A specific area.** One or more paths → audit just those. Use when you suspect a module is decaying, or before you start a change in code you don't trust.

```
/ds-code-quality-review the whole codebase, not just recent changes
```
**Everything.** Freeform "full codebase" scope → a project-wide structural audit. Slower and noisier; reach for it when onboarding to a repo, planning a refactor, or doing a periodic health check. Expect it to find cross-file duplication and sprawl that a branch-scoped pass can't see.

> Rule of thumb: branch-scoped before every PR, area-scoped when something smells, full-codebase occasionally.

---

## The draft-PR grill loop

Stress-test the *approach* of a change before you ask a human to review it.

1. **Open a draft PR** from your branch so there's a stable thing to point at:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --draft --fill
   ```
2. **Grill the design**, pointing `/ds-grill-me` at the PR and recording decisions:
   ```
   /ds-grill-me --record  the approach in this PR: <paste PR URL or describe the diff>
   ```
   It interviews you one branch at a time — edge cases, alternatives you skipped, invariants you're assuming — and logs each resolved decision to `DECISIONS.md`.
3. **Incorporate** the decisions: make the code changes, and let `DECISIONS.md` become (or seed) the PR description so reviewers see the *why*.
4. **Mark ready:**
   ```bash
   gh pr ready
   ```

Why this order: the cheapest time to discover the design is wrong is *before* a reviewer spends their attention on it. The draft PR gives the conversation an anchor; `DECISIONS.md` gives the reviewer your reasoning for free.

`/ds-grill-me` does far more than PR review — requirements discovery, design stress-testing, refactor planning, domain/terminology sharpening, even non-coding decisions. See [grill-me.md](grill-me.md) for the full menu.

---

## Generate, then clean: `/ds-deslop` before review

Fresh AI-generated code carries slop — narrating comments, defensive overkill in trusted paths, type escape hatches that only dodge the checker, needless nesting. `/ds-deslop` judges against the language's idioms and the surrounding code (so it won't flag idiomatic Go `any`, or look for `try/catch` in a language that has none). Clean it before anyone (human or `/ds-code-quality-review`) looks at it.

```
# after generating a batch of code on a branch
/ds-deslop
# scoped, if you only want to clean part of it
/ds-deslop src/handlers/
```

`/ds-deslop` is **narrow and behavior-preserving** — it tidies style and removes noise. It is *not* a structural audit. The two compose:

```
/ds-deslop                  # remove the noise first
/ds-code-quality-review     # then judge the structure that remains
```

Doing it in that order means the structural review isn't distracted by slop, and its findings are about real design, not formatting.

---

## Find then prove: `/ds-debug` → `/ds-verify-this` for a bugfix

When you don't yet know *why* it fails, start with `/ds-debug` — it reproduces first, narrows to the root cause one hypothesis at a time, applies a minimal fix, then hands the proven fix to `/ds-verify-this`. A passing test isn't proof the user-visible bug is gone; `/ds-verify-this` captures before/after evidence and returns a hard verdict — **no CI needed**.

```
/ds-verify-this  the fix on this branch makes `mytool parse bad.json` exit 0 instead of panicking
```

It will: restate the claim falsifiably, run the repro against the parent commit (baseline) and your branch (treatment) with the same command/env, diff the artifacts, and return `VERIFIED` / `NOT VERIFIED` / `INCONCLUSIVE`. Use it when:

- a bugfix needs a real before/after repro,
- "is it actually faster?" (same-machine baseline vs treatment timings),
- a test is green but you want to confirm the behavior a user sees.

Give it something measurable. It will refuse "the code is cleaner" — that's a `/ds-code-quality-review` question, not a verification one.

---

## Find then prove: `/ds-perf-plan` → `/ds-verify-this` for a speedup

Performance work is the most hallucination-prone — "this loop looks slow, add a cache" with no measurement breaks clean code and often *pessimizes*. The pairing closes that gap: `/ds-perf-plan` finds the candidates and refuses any without a cost model (Big-O, alloc/IO/query counts, or a profile), tagging each `measured` / `reasoned` / `speculative` and by architectural cost (L1/L2/L3). Then you apply the move you choose and `/ds-verify-this` proves the win with a same-machine baseline/treatment.

```
/ds-perf-plan src/index/            # rank costed moves; free wins (L1) first
/ds-perf-plan --max-level=1         # or: only the behavior- and structure-preserving wins
   ...apply the move you picked...
/ds-verify-this  `bench query big.idx` runs ≥2× faster on this branch vs parent
```

`/ds-perf-plan` names the *price* of each speedup, so trading architecture for speed (L3) is a deliberate choice; `/ds-verify-this` makes sure the speedup is real before you keep it. Reach for it when a path is hot or a change is perf-sensitive — not as a blanket pass over code that isn't.

---

## A pre-PR quality gate

Stitch the quality commands into one gate you run before marking a PR ready:

```
/ds-deslop                  # 1. remove slop introduced on the branch
/ds-code-quality-review     # 2. structure: is the diff making the codebase worse?
/ds-bug-review              # 3. correctness: real bugs, not style
/ds-security-review         # 4. exploitability — if it touches input, auth, secrets, or I/O
/ds-data-review             # 5. data correctness — if it touches schema, queries, transactions, or migrations
/ds-test-quality-review     # 6. is the risky logic actually covered, with good tests?
/ds-perf-plan               # 7. performance: where is it doing more work than needed? (perf-sensitive changes)
/ds-go-review               # 8. language pass (or /ds-ts-review, /ds-rust-review)
/ds-verify-this  <claim>    # 9. prove the headline change actually works
```

Then write the PR description from what you learned and `gh pr ready`. Each step answers a *different* question — slop (noise), structure, correctness, exploitability, data correctness, test coverage, performance, language idioms, behavior — so they don't overlap. Not every PR needs all nine: reach for `/ds-security-review` when it touches untrusted input, `/ds-data-review` when it touches schema/queries/migrations, `/ds-test-quality-review` when the logic is non-trivial, `/ds-perf-plan` when a path is hot or the change is perf-sensitive. Run the questions that apply.

---

## A standalone build loop

This loop covers the full spec-to-ship ground — spec, plan, build, verify, ship — using only standalone commands:

```
/ds-spec                    # 1. WHAT: a SPEC.md with acceptance criteria (optional)
/ds-explore                 # 2. at a fork: lay out approaches → EXPLORE.md (--web to research)
/ds-grill-me --record       # 3. decide the open branches → DECISIONS.md
/ds-zoom-out                # 4. in unfamiliar code: map the area before changing it
/ds-tiger-style-mode             # 5. engineering bar on (stack /ds-test-mode to keep the core covered, /ds-git-mode to land each working unit as a clean commit)
   ...build it, driving the design yourself...
/ds-deslop                  # 6. clean the generated code
/ds-code-quality-review     # 7. audit structure before review
/ds-verify-this <claim>     # 8. prove the acceptance criteria hold
```

Ship with plain `git` + `gh`. The artifacts that persist your thinking are `SPEC.md` and `DECISIONS.md` — commit them. This is deliberately lighter than a phase-based engine: fewer moving parts, no background state, faster to start.

To carry plan and state *across* sessions (so `/clear` is always safe), layer the `.project/` memory commands on top — `/ds-project-map`, `/ds-project-checkpoint`, `/ds-project-resume` — and seed the plan with `/ds-roadmap`. See [project-workflow.md](project-workflow.md).

---

## Drive a multi-PR contribution queue (one PR per issue, `/clear`-safe)

When you have a backlog of independent changes to land as *separate* PRs — a queue of issues, or a big refactor split into reviewable chunks — the `.project/` files turn it into a loop that survives `/clear` and hands cleanly between sessions. The plan *is* the protocol.

1. **Map once, plan the queue.** `/ds-project-map` writes `.project/PROJECT.md` (the repo facts every issue shares). Then capture the queue in `.project/PLAN.md`: issue order, a **Current** pointer (which issue, which step), and the per-issue loop (branch → implement → `npm test` → draft PR → grill → ready → merged → sync). Putting the protocol *in the plan* is what makes the session reconstructible after a `/clear`.
2. **One branch + one draft PR per issue.** Branch off fresh `main`, implement surgically from the issue's spec, run the tests, open a **draft** PR. Record the PR URL under Current in `PLAN.md`.
3. **Grill the draft, then mark ready.** Point `/ds-grill-me` at the open PR to stress-test the *approach* one decision at a time; apply what it surfaces, then `gh pr ready`. (This is [the draft-PR grill loop](#the-draft-pr-grill-loop) used as one step of the larger loop.)
4. **Confirm-then-advance at the gates.** Treat *mark-ready* and *merged* as human checkpoints — never assume a merge. Once merged: `git fetch upstream && git checkout main && git merge --ff-only upstream/main`, delete the branch, tick the issue off, and move the Current pointer to the next one.
5. **Checkpoint before `/clear`.** Because `PLAN.md` always holds Current issue + step + PR URL, you can `/clear` between issues (or hand to a fresh agent via `/ds-project-resume`) and resume exactly where you left off — no transcript needed.

Why it holds up: each issue is an isolated branch+PR (small, reviewable, revertible), the queue's state lives in a file instead of the conversation, and the ready/merged gates stay human. `.project/` is the shared memory; `git` + `gh` do the rest.

---

## Drive a plan with full control

When you want to *drive* — approve, steer, or replan at every step instead of letting a long autonomous run unfold — turn an existing plan over to `/ds-step-mode`:

```
/ds-roadmap                 # (or any plan: a path, or pasted text)
/ds-step-mode current plan       # work it one step at a time, gated
   ...for each step: it proposes → you approve/amend/combine/redirect → it does one step → stops...
/ds-project-checkpoint           # at a milestone, persist state so /clear is safe
```

The discipline that makes this work: it proposes the next step and **waits** (a free veto before anything changes), does the smallest reviewable unit, then hands control back **in prose** — options are suggestions you can accept *and add to*, never a forced single-select picker. Say "bigger steps" / "smaller steps" to tune granularity live. Stacks with `/ds-git-mode` (each approved step ≈ a commit) for a driven, cleanly-committed build.

---

## Greenfield: design the architecture before you build

`/ds-spec` and `/ds-explore` get you to *what* and *which options* — but neither commits to a structure. `/ds-blueprint` is the decisive step that does: it takes the requirements and recommends one architecture — modules, dependency rules, seams, build order — then you build the walking skeleton first.

```
/ds-spec                    # WHAT: requirements + acceptance criteria → SPEC.md
/ds-explore                 # options at the big forks (--web to research references)
/ds-blueprint  SPEC.md      # commit to one architecture: modules, deps, seams, build order
/ds-roadmap            # turn the build order into an ordered task list
   ...build the walking skeleton, then the increments...
```

`/ds-blueprint`'s spine is YAGNI — every layer/boundary/queue must trace to a stated requirement, so you get the simplest structure that meets the actual scale, not a cargo-culted one. It states what it deliberately deferred and what would justify adding it later.

---

## Onboarding a codebase inherited in a bad state

When you adopt a running project whose architecture is already wrong, `/ds-code-quality-review` won't help — it works *within* the architecture. `/ds-architecture-plan` works *on* it: it questions whether the structure itself is sound and lays out a sequenced, risk-tagged refactoring roadmap.

```
/ds-zoom-out                     # 1. map the system first — modules, callers, boundaries
/ds-architecture-plan            # 2. critique + sequenced roadmap (L1/L2/L3 by blast radius)
/ds-architecture-plan --max-level=1   # or: safe, in-place wins only to start
/ds-roadmap                 # 3. turn the roadmap into ordered tasks
   ...build each step; add characterization tests at the seam before risky moves...
/ds-verify-this <claim>          # 4. prove a risky move preserved behavior
```

Every step in the plan is anchored to a concrete symptom in *your* codebase — a cycle path, files that co-change, logic in the wrong layer at `file:line` — never generic "go DDD" advice. Mind the altitude split: `/ds-architecture-plan` owns the architecture itself; `/ds-code-quality-review` owns file/function/abstraction cleanup within it.

---

## Building a UI feature

`/ds-ui-mode` is a mode — turn it on and it stays active, shaping every component you build that session. It slots into the build loop above:

```
/ds-ui-mode                      # UI mode on: engineering + design craft, framework-agnostic
/ds-explore                 # at a layout/interaction fork: lay out options (--web for references)
   ...build it: components, minimal co-located state, explicit loading/error/empty states, a11y...
/ds-deslop                  # strip any generated slop
/ds-verify-this "the form shows an inline error and keeps focus when the email is invalid"
```

Because `/ds-ui-mode` encodes design constraints (type scale, spacing tokens, visual hierarchy) up front, you escape the generic AI look without re-prompting for "polish" each time. Verify what the user actually sees — a screenshot or a keyboard-navigation transcript is the evidence, not a green unit test.

---

## Building a data pipeline

`/ds-data-mode` is the data analogue of `/ds-ui-mode`: turn it on and every transform you build that session is shaped against the naive ETL defaults (read-all → overwrite, assume data arrives once and in order, crash on a bad record, no replay). Stack it with the test mode and verify the property that actually matters — a backfill reprocesses cleanly:

```
/ds-data-mode                    # discipline on: idempotency, late/out-of-order data, schema drift, replay-safety
/ds-test-mode                    # cover the transforms as you build (stacks)
   ...build it: pure transforms, upsert-on-key writes, event-time windowing, boundary assertions...
/ds-verify-this "re-running yesterday's window produces identical row counts and totals — no double-counting"
/ds-data-review --pipelines      # audit the pipeline code + the store it writes to
```

The mode shapes how the pipeline gets *built*; `/ds-data-review --pipelines` audits the built pipeline code (idempotency, replay-safety, late-data handling, schema-drift contracts), and plain `/ds-data-review` audits the *store* it writes to (schema, constraints, transactions, migrations). They're complements, not duplicates — run the mode while building, the review before merging.

---

## Surviving long sessions

Two failure modes on long tasks: the context window fills, and prose burns tokens.

- **Continuity** — when you're switching sessions/machines or pausing mid-task, capture state instead of trusting the transcript:
  ```
  /ds-handoff  next: wire the retry logic into the client and add the timeout test
  ```
  It writes a `handoff.md` (goal, done, remaining, decisions, open questions) and returns the path. Start the next session by pointing the agent at that file. Do this *before* the context gets so full the summary degrades.

- **Compression** — for long iterative back-and-forth, drop the prose overhead:
  ```
  /ds-caveman-lite-mode            # ~25–35% less prose, full explanatory value
  /ds-caveman-ultra-mode           # ~75–85% less; fragments + notation, ask for detail when needed
  ```
  Code, commits, PR bodies, and safety warnings stay written in full regardless.

- **Big inputs** — before pasting a long doc or page into context, compress it losslessly-ish:
  ```
  /ds-tldt https://example.com/long-rfc
  /ds-tldt ./DESIGN.md
  ```

## Context recycling with recall (experimental)

Requires [recall](https://github.com/gleicon/recall). The idea: every session with an AI assistant burns tokens building context from scratch. recall indexes your project locally, accumulates cross-project recipes and insights, and routes questions through a local model before hitting the cloud API — so you reuse what you already paid for.

### First-time setup

```
/ds-recall-setup
```

This indexes the current project, seeds default framework recipes (Go, Next.js, Python, Rust, others), and wires a session-end reminder into Claude Code and OpenCode. Run once per project, re-run after major structural changes.

### Starting a session with recall context

```
/ds-recall
```

Always run this at the start of a session on a known project. recall maps the project (idempotent) and injects a context-rich brief — prior patterns, matched recipes, relevant cross-project knowledge. The main LLM receives a pre-enriched context and needs fewer tokens to orient itself.

```
/ds-recall query "how do I add middleware to this router?"
```

For a specific question, route it through recall first. If a local model can answer from the indexed recipes, you skip the cloud API entirely. If not, recall returns an enriched brief that reduces the token cost of the cloud call.

```
/ds-recall brain
```

Pull the accumulated cross-project knowledge base — patterns and recipes from everything recall has indexed across your projects. Useful when starting work in a new project that shares patterns with ones you've worked on before.

### Capturing a session's outcome

When you resolve something worth keeping — a bug class, a design decision, a framework-specific pattern — store it before clearing the context:

```
/ds-recall-capture
```

recall extracts signal only: **goal** (one line), **result** (one line), **insight** (one to three lines). No reasoning chain. No failed attempts. The compact recipe is stored in recall's local knowledge base and becomes available in future sessions across all your projects.

Run this **before** `/clear` — the context is gone after.

### A full session with recall

```
# session start — orient recall and inject context
/ds-recall

# ... work, debug, build ...

# before ending
/ds-recall-capture   # store the outcome
/ds-project-checkpoint  # update the .project/ plan (if in use)
/clear
```

### Token budget framing

recall is a **staged composition**: local context → local model → cloud API. Each stage is only reached if the previous one can't answer. A session that would have cost 50k tokens without context can drop significantly when recall's brief eliminates the orientation pass and routes common questions locally.

The savings are real only when recall has indexed relevant prior work. Seed it early, capture consistently.
