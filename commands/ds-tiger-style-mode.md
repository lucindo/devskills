Activate Tiger Style enforcement for this session.

Tiger Style is TigerBeetle's engineering philosophy. Source: https://tigerstyle.dev/
Full spec: https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md

Apply these constraints to all code you write or review for the remainder of this session.

## Priority Order

Safety > Performance > Developer Experience. Never trade safety for convenience. Never trade correctness for speed.

## Safety Rules

**Assertions**
- Minimum 2 assertions per function: validate arguments on entry, validate return values and invariants before return.
- Assert at the boundary of every external call (OS, disk, network).
- Prefer pair assertions: enforce each property from at least two distinct code paths.
- Assertions are not error handling. They document invariants that MUST hold. If an assertion fails, it is a bug in your code, not the user's input.

**Control Flow**
- No recursion unless termination is formally proven. Use iterative equivalents.
- Every loop has an explicit iteration bound. Assert the bound is not exceeded.
- No goto. No setjmp/longjmp equivalents.
- Minimize branches. Flatten nesting. Early returns are acceptable.

**Memory**
- No dynamic allocation after initialization. Allocate everything upfront, statically.
- No unbounded data structures. Every queue, buffer, and collection has a fixed maximum capacity.
- Assert capacity before every append or push.

**Error Handling**
- Every error must be handled explicitly. No silent discard.
- Do not use exceptions for control flow.
- Propagate errors explicitly through return values, not side channels.

**Dependencies**
- Zero external dependencies unless strictly necessary. Justify each dependency.
- Treat each dependency as a liability: it adds surface area, upgrade cost, and failure modes.

## Performance Rules

**Design-time performance**
- Before writing a non-trivial function, sketch the performance budget: network, disk, memory, compute.
- Batch operations to amortize per-call costs.
- Separate control plane (low-frequency, high-latency-tolerant) from data plane (high-frequency, latency-critical).
- Avoid allocations in hot paths. Prefer pre-allocated buffers.

**Measurement**
- Do not optimize without a measurement. State the baseline before the change.
- Profile at the system level, not the function level.

## Code Structure Rules

**Functions**
- Maximum 70 lines per function. If longer, extract logical units.
- One purpose per function. If you cannot name it with a verb-noun pair, split it.
- Explicit is better than implicit. Pass parameters explicitly; do not rely on global or ambient state.

**Naming**
- snake_case for all identifiers.
- Include units in variable names: `timeout_ms`, `size_bytes`, `count_max`.
- Include qualifiers: `is_valid`, `has_error`, `was_committed`.
- No abbreviations except for loop indices and well-established domain terms.
- Big-endian naming: general concept before specific qualifier (`timestamp_created_at` not `created_at_timestamp`).

**Scope**
- Minimize variable scope. Declare variables as close to use as possible.
- No global mutable state in hot paths.

**Comments**
- No comments that restate what the code does. Code must be readable without them.
- Comments document WHY: hidden constraints, non-obvious invariants, workarounds for specific bugs.
- Assertions often replace comments: if you want to write "x must be positive here", assert it instead.

## Technical Debt

- Zero tolerance. Fix problems during design and implementation.
- If a fix cannot be done now, file a tracked issue with a deadline. Do not leave TODO comments without a ticket.
- Shortcuts taken now cost exponentially more in production.

## Review Checklist

When reviewing code under Tiger Style, check:

1. Does every function have at least 2 assertions?
2. Are all loops bounded with explicit limits?
3. Is there any dynamic allocation post-initialization?
4. Are all errors explicitly handled?
5. Does any function exceed 70 lines?
6. Are variable names precise (include units, qualifiers)?
7. Is there any recursion without formal termination proof?
8. Does any new external dependency appear without justification?
9. Are performance-critical paths allocation-free?
10. Is each error path tested?

## Reporting Format

When flagging Tiger Style violations during review, use:

```
tiger-style violation: <rule category>
location: <file>:<line>
violation: <what the code does>
fix: <what it should do instead>
```

This skill remains active for the current session. Respond with "Tiger Style active." to confirm activation, then proceed with the user's task.
