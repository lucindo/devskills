Verify a claim with fresh local evidence: restate it falsifiably, capture baseline and treatment, compare artifacts, and return VERIFIED, NOT VERIFIED, or INCONCLUSIVE.

Verification is not a recap. It proves or disproves a specific claim with repeatable evidence.

## When To Use

- The user asks "verify this", "prove it works", "did this fix it", or "show me the evidence".
- A bug fix needs a before/after repro.
- A UI, CLI, API, performance, or memory claim needs measurement.
- A test passes but the user-visible behavior still needs confirmation.

Do not use this for vague claims like "the code is cleaner". Ask for a measurable claim first.

To *find* the cause of a failure (not just confirm a fix), use `/ds-debug` first — it ends by handing the proven fix to this command.

## Workflow

1. Restate the claim in falsifiable form: condition, metric, and threshold.
2. Pick the smallest local surface that can disprove it.
3. Capture a baseline from the old state: merge base, parent commit, failing branch, or current broken repro.
4. Capture treatment from the changed state with the same command, data, warmup, and environment.
5. Compare raw artifacts: numbers, screenshots, terminal transcripts, HTTP responses, profiles, heap snapshots, or test output.
6. Return exactly one verdict: `VERIFIED`, `NOT VERIFIED`, or `INCONCLUSIVE`.

## Local Surfaces

Capture baseline and treatment with the smallest repeatable *local* harness — reuse the repo's own test/demo/e2e scripts before building anything. No CI required.

- **Code behavior**: a focused unit/integration test or a minimal repro script.
- **CLI/TUI behavior**: a deterministic terminal harness — the repo's own scripts, or `tmux` (`send-keys` / `capture-pane`) or a short PTY script — saved as a before/after transcript.
- **UI behavior**: the repo's browser harness (Playwright/Cypress), or a one-off probe against the local dev server — screenshots or accessibility snapshots.
- **API behavior**: a local HTTP/RPC request, diffing the responses.
- **Performance**: same-machine baseline/treatment timings or CPU profiles.
- **Memory**: heap snapshots before and after the suspected operation.

## Artifact Layout

When safe to write artifacts:

```text
/tmp/verify-this/<claim-slug>/
├── claim.md
├── timeline.md
├── baseline/
├── treatment/
├── diff/
└── verdict.md
```

If artifacts may contain sensitive code, prompts, screenshots, HTTP bodies, or heap data, keep only the minimal inline evidence unless the user agrees to disk storage.

## Verdict Rules

- `VERIFIED`: baseline and treatment differ in the predicted direction, by the claimed threshold, with no obvious confound.
- `NOT VERIFIED`: the behavior is unchanged, moves the wrong way, or misses the threshold.
- `INCONCLUSIVE`: no valid baseline, noisy signal, failed measurement, or an environment difference invalidates the comparison.

## Output

Use this shape:

```text
VERIFIED | NOT VERIFIED | INCONCLUSIVE
Claim: <falsifiable claim>

Evidence:
<metric/artifact>: baseline=<...>, treatment=<...>, delta=<...>, threshold=<...>

Reasoning:
<one tight paragraph naming the evidence and any confounds>
```

Do not soften a negative result. A clear `NOT VERIFIED` is useful.
